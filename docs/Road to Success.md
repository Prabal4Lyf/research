In Chapter 2, Building and Sustaining a Research Program, the author discusses the importance of taking a systematic approach to research in order to build and sustain a successful research program. The author suggests that the key to a successful research program is to emphasize depth over breadth, and provides principles that have worked for them in their own research pursuits. The author also encourages PhD students to consider their research in terms of a program and to be mindful of their ambition in order to scope their dissertation project down to a manageable size. Finally, the author reflects on the advice they have received from others, which has contributed to their successful research program.

In order to manage a pipeline, one must have research projects in all stages of the research process going at any given time. This requires developing and maintaining a solid pipeline that has a steady stream of publications over time. The five basic strategies for managing a pipeline are: Streams of research, getting practical about streams, research project versus research study, populating your pipeline, and planning. 

Streams of research refer to working within a particular topic area and having an overarching research question. The overarching research question should be relentlessly pursued in order to answer it, and this may require turning down research projects that do not contribute to the chosen research question.

Getting practical about streams involves deciding on a few well-defined research streams, each of which has an overarching research question, and then relentlessly pursuing various aspects of the chosen overarching research question. This often requires turning down research projects that do not contribute to answering the chosen research question. Additionally, it is important to plan ahead and try to keep a steady stream of publications flowing by managing a research pipeline, which is the series of research projects and/or papers that a researcher has at various stages of completion.

A research project is larger in scope and involves a research design that can answer multiple interrelated questions and potentially includes more than one research study. A research study, on the other hand, is much more focused and typically only results in one paper. A research project allows for multiple papers and different plans of attack, as well as the potential for longitudinal data collection and better papers as a result.

Populating your pipeline involves coming up with new research projects to continually add to the pipeline. This includes brainstorming new ideas and questions and looking for related studies from other academic fields that can be applied to the research stream. Once ideas have been identified, it is important to plan out the research project. This includes creating an outline of the research objectives, gathering the necessary data, and organizing the project timeline. Finally, it is important to actively work on the research projects in order to move them through the pipeline.

When working on a doctoral dissertation, it is important to plan ahead and to be organized. To ensure success, it is important to have specific goals and to break them down into short-term goals, a semester plan, a monthly plan, a weekly plan, and a daily plan. It is also important to recognize that plans will need to adapt and evolve, and that tasks take longer to accomplish than one might expect. Additionally, it is helpful to have a plan for each semester, such as a planning document similar to Table 8-1 in Decision Line. 

When selecting a dissertation topic, it is important to choose a topic that is interesting and motivating. It is also helpful to look at resources such as Decision Line articles and Gordon Davis’ book “Writing the Doctoral Dissertation” for guidance in selecting a dissertation topic, choosing an advisor, forming a committee, making steady progress, and measuring progress.

When collecting data for a dissertation, it is important to think of research projects more broadly than just a research study. If conducting longitudinal field research, it is important to collect more data than is necessary for the dissertation requirements. 

# Chapter 3

This chapter outlines strategies for developing a healthy pipeline of research projects and publications. The author provides five key areas: streams of research, getting practical about streams, research project versus research study, populating your pipeline, and plan, plan, plan. The author discusses the importance of having an overarching research question for each stream of research and the need to relentlessly pursue various aspects of the chosen overarching research question. The author also provides examples from their own experiences to illustrate these points.

Doctoral students can develop a pipeline of papers by three strategies. The first strategy is to identify a research topic and explore it through reading the literature and attending doctoral seminars. The second strategy is to explore various topics by taking multiple courses. The third strategy is to work with faculty members who are conducting research. This offers the student an opportunity to learn the skills associated with crafting papers, draw from the professor's knowledge base, and have the potential to write and publish more papers.

The key takeaways from the chapter are: 
1. Develop and maintain a research pipeline in order to build and sustain a research program. 
2. Streamline research into a few well-defined streams of research with an overarching research question. 
3. Utilize practical strategies to manage the pipeline such as organizing research projects versus research studies, populating the pipeline, and planning ahead. 
4. Be mindful of cycle time, number of revisions, complexity of revisions, and luck of the draw when managing the pipeline. 
5. Turn down research projects that do not contribute to answering the overarching research question.


When outlining a paper, we should take care to make sure that the introduction is concise and clearly conveys the paper's topic, the business problem is presented in a way that is convincing and highlights the significance of the research, the theoretical problem is presented in a way that highlights the gap in the literature that the research will address, and the objectives are clearly stated and are tied to the business problem and scientific gap. Additionally, the abstract should be between 100 and 200 words and should discuss the main research question, what was done, and what was found.

The outline of a paper is as follows: 
1. Article title 
2. Version #
3. Abstract:
4. Introduction: 
5. Business Problem (or Applied Problem) and Significance 
6. Theoretical Problem and Significance 
7. Objectives 
8. Expected Contributions 
9. Background 
10. Theory Development 
11. Method 
12. Results 
13. Discussion 
14. Conclusion 
15. Limitations 
16. Implications 
17. Future Research


Outline of a paper 
    * There are many tools for writing—you should find one that works for you: some create a slide show to tell a story, others use a standard outline, while some prefer to write a clear abstract 
    * In using the outline approach, think about an hourglass where the broadest part is at both ends of the paper—i.e., introduction and discussion 
    * An introduction should not be narrowly conceived—it should be about the broader context 
    * Strive for a coherent story and thematic organization of the literature (a chronological organization, for example, does nothing) 
    * Roadmaps are of value—tell the reader where you are going 
    * Never attack people or ideas in your writing—rather, build on ideas 
    * The outlining tool provided in Table 4-1 can be used to iteratively flesh out a paper 
    * Once you have crafted the basic storyline or draft of the paper, critically review it, even if that means completely rewriting the paper  


# Chapter 4 

This chapter provides advice on how to write an empirical article for journals in the social and behavioral sciences. It focuses on writing papers targeted towards information systems, organizational behavior, human resources, and marketing journals. The chapter provides references to other sources for further advice and tips. It introduces five strategies to aid in the writing process: framing and telling an interesting story, fishing, writing and thinking, outlining a paper, and the hat trick. It emphasizes the importance of framing the paper in the most interesting way possible to capture the attention of reviewers.

The key takeaways from this chapter are:
1. Framing and telling an interesting story is key to capturing the reader's attention and ensuring the paper is accepted.
2. Fishing is an important step in the paper-writing process and involves gathering research and data to support the main argument.
3. Writing and thinking go hand in hand when it comes to developing a paper; each process should help inform the other.
4. An outline of the paper is a helpful tool in organizing thoughts and ideas in a logical and coherent manner.
5. The Hat Trick strategy involves reviewing the paper multiple times to ensure the content is clear, concise, and error-free.

# Chapter 8

To manage the PhD program years 1 and 2 effectively, it is important to be honest with yourself about your strengths and weaknesses, collaborate with others strategically, mix business and pleasure, and keep the number of collaborators manageable. It is also important to make sure that you are taking the time to reflect on what you have learned and identify any knowledge or skill gaps you may have. 
Finally, be aware of the demands of the PhD program and manage your time effectively to ensure that you are able to complete all of your tasks and responsibilities.

A planning document is a document created by doctoral students and junior faculty members to reflect on the student's previous semester activities and learning, and to develop a plan for the upcoming semester. The document includes information such as the student's name, the semester/year they entered the PhD program, the date comps were passed (if applicable), dissertation topic and advisor (if applicable), coursework, research interests, journal publications, conference proceedings, and progress reports on any working papers. It is recommended that the document be discussed with a faculty mentor or PhD program director three times a year: at the start of fall, spring, and summer.

Summer research is an important opportunity for PhD students to focus heavily on their research projects. It is a unique time during the year when students are typically not taking classes and can dedicate more time to their research. During the first summer, it is a great chance for students to put into practice the theories they learned in their first year, as well as collect data for a research project. The second summer can be used to scope out a topic for a dissertation, and prepare for comprehensive exams.

Being well rounded means having a balanced approach to life that incorporates both academic and personal goals. It involves understanding and taking action to achieve balance, developing clarity in goals and values, applying methods of knowledge work planning and schedule discipline, managing both work and personal times, and being flexible and allowing for unplanned and unexpected events.

Theory-building and writing is a process of building theories from research data, using disciplined imagination and paradox to build theories. It involves understanding the role of time in theory building, as well as constructing mystery through empirical matters. Additionally, it involves recognizing what theory is not, and understanding what constitutes a theoretical contribution. Finally, it requires taking into account the essential impact of context on organizational behavior.

1. PhD programs can be overwhelming, especially in the early stages.
2. Attrition/dropout rates are highest in the first two years of the PhD program. 
3. Managing the PhD program effectively is not a trivial task.
4. Students often run helter-skelter, cramming classes, duties, reading and research into a standard work week.
5. Programs are not designed for students to pause and reflect.
6. It is important to be honest with yourself about strengths and weaknesses, and collaborate with those who have complementary strengths.
7. Working with friends can be beneficial, but communication is key to avoiding potential issues.
8. It is important to be selective and not stretch yourself too thin when it comes to collaborations.


# Chapter 9

The third year of the PhD program is often referred to as the "black hole" due to the shift from the structured phase to the unstructured phase. Students may experience burnout from the first two years of pressure, or become complacent due to the lack of external deadlines. To avoid this, it is recommended that students take a break after their comprehensive exam, impose structure through goal-setting and creating plans, and find a suitable dissertation topic.


Research scholars need to take a break after the comprehensive exam verdict is announced, impose structure through goal-setting, have a plan for the semester, break the semester plan into a monthly plan, break the monthly plan into a weekly plan, break the weekly plan into a daily plan, recognize that plans will need to adapt and evolve, and recognize that tasks take longer to accomplish than what is usually expected. Additionally, they need to put in effort to find a suitable dissertation topic.

A dissertation is an extensive written document that is typically part of a graduate-level degree program. It is usually composed of several parts that relate to a student's research project, and typically consists of an introduction, literature review, model development, methods, results, discussion, and conclusions. In recent years, a new format for dissertations has been developed, consisting of papers rather than sections. This format typically includes an introduction, paper, and can be more conducive to generating multiple publishable papers from the same research project.



How to write dissertation 
Writing a dissertation can be a daunting task, but it can be accomplished by breaking it down into manageable steps. First, choose a dissertation topic that is sufficiently interesting so that you will be motivated to work on it. Then, create a plan for the semester, breaking it down into monthly, weekly, and daily plans that can be adapted and evolved as needed. Additionally, recognize that tasks take longer to accomplish than you might expect, so be sure to give yourself enough time to complete each step of the process. 

Once you have a plan in place, it is important to think of research projects more broadly than just collecting data. Consider collecting more data than is required for the dissertation, as this may be beneficial, especially if you are conducting longitudinal field research. 

When writing the dissertation, consider organizing it in the form of a three-essay or three-paper model. This model includes an introduction, literature review, model development, method, results, discussion, and conclusions. Each paper should be written as a self-contained empirical journal article, and should be around 40 double-spaced pages. By writing the dissertation in this way, you can ensure that after graduation, you have three papers ready to be submitted to journals. 


Structure 
A dissertation typically has an overarching introduction that scopes the broader problem and catalogs potential unanswered questions that might be tackled in each of the different papers. The dissertation then has each paper as a self-contained empirical journal article that is in the neighborhood of 40 pages double-spaced. At the end of the dissertation, there is a conclusions section that presents insights at a higher level of abstraction than any of the individual papers and ties the insights to the introduction.

Dissertation paper
To write a paper on the dissertation topic, it is important to first choose a topic that is timely and feasible, and one that is of sufficient interest to motivate the student. It is important to keep notes on dissertation possibilities throughout the graduate program, and to allow the advisor to help develop a topic with the student. It is also important to think of the dissertation as part of the doctoral education program and to strive to complete the dissertation in reasonable time. Additionally, it is important to think of research projects more broadly than narrow research studies, and to collect more data than meets the dissertation requirements.


# Chapter 10 

This chapter looks back at the author's experiences in the PhD program from the perspective of hindsight, discussing what went well and what could have been improved. The author identifies five things they got right, such as working on multiple projects within a few streams, advancing their portfolio, working with organizations, keeping a book of ideas, and not allowing themselves to get discouraged. They also discuss five things they would have done differently, such as dealing with the perfectionism-procrastination paradox, getting on top of time management/deadline issues, risking breadth for depth, balancing work and life, and getting over the impostor syndrome. The author reflects on how they found a topic area that captured their imagination and had a lens of looking at topics to see how it could be advanced from a social perspective.

The key takeaways from the chapter IF I ONLY KNEW THEN... are:

1. Work on many projects, but focus on a few streams.
2. Make the most of every opportunity.
3. Collaborate with organizations.
4. Keep a record of ideas.
5. Don't let discouragement take over.
6. Tackle perfectionism and procrastination.
7. Master time management and deadlines.
8. Take risks to gain depth.
9. Balance work and life.
10. Overcome the impostor syndrome.

The imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where people have difficulty internalizing their accomplishments and successes, and instead feel like they are not deserving or have not earned their achievements. This can lead to feelings of insecurity and self-doubt despite evidence of success.



# Chapter 11 

This chapter contains four essays that offer advice and guidance to doctoral students and junior faculty members on how to succeed in their doctoral program and academic career. 
Essay 1 explains a model for success in doctoral studies and outlines four components necessary for success: motivation, competence, program management, and the ability to absorb and integrate knowledge. 
Essay 2 discusses common mistakes that students make in managing their doctoral program and how to avoid them. 
Essay 3 provides useful advice on taking stock and reflecting on one's progress and challenges. 
Finally, Essay 4 discusses the importance of networking and offers tips on how to go about it. 
Collectively, these essays offer advice and guidance to help students become successful and outstanding stewards of their field.


The key takeaways from the chapter FOUR ESSAYS ON SUCCESS IN A DOCTORAL PROGRAM: A MODEL OF SUCCESS, AVOIDING MISTAKES, TAKING STOCK AND NETWORKING are:

1. Doctoral study requires four key ingredients: motivation to work hard, pursuing the unstructured process of knowledge creation, competence to absorb and integrate knowledge, and the ability to manage the PhD program.
2. Motivation and competence work synergistically – when complemented with good management, students can be on their way to being successful in their program and career.
3. Student inputs and program processes work to produce student outputs such as process success, outcome success, and satisfaction.
4. Doctoral students should make efforts to create synergy between their research and teaching opportunities, be proactive, evaluate opportunities carefully, and establish and nurture communication links.


The importance of checking and networking for doctoral students is clear. 
Checking helps students to measure their progress and ensure that they are meeting the necessary requirements of their program. 
Networking helps students to build strong relationships with other professionals in the field and exchange ideas and information. 
Networking can also provide students with access to resources and opportunities that may not be available to them otherwise. 
Furthermore, networking can help students to make connections and create a sense of belonging within the academic community.
